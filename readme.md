# Kainat OS
## By Kainat Quaderee


# Welcome TO Kainat OS
Kainat OS is an operating system based on Debian. This operating system is for people who like GUI more than CLI, which doesn't mean it doesn't provide cli. Just more GUI and gaming-friendly OS.

# Features
## Custom KDE based Kainat Light Desktop or KLD:
KLD desktop   adds more GUI apps made by the Godot Game Engine. Here you can find some basic user-friendly GUI

## cli works with low-level GUI and Kdialogs
## used bash script and kdialogs for basic works, installing debs, etc, which gives low-level GUI with Kdialog
